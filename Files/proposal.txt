Proposal for PageRankTeam

Our goal is to make the teams that possibly everyone can satisfied with.

We set a person's preference as 5,1,1,1,1,1 because everyone should has a person they really want to be with and several "okay" choices but cannot make them that happy and really not have that much difference for them with other people.

We started to looking for the first choice from bottom because they are not that popular for most of students, if they can make pairs, that will be awesome. 

If Nobody is found in those groups, We give them the person who has the highest pagerank because he was prefered by most people. (team should be happy to have a people that everyone wants)

And we do same thing based on the last person in group.
(using his preference to find next guy) Because we have already go through all people's preference that before
we either
#1 Find the first choice of him
#2 Not find the first choice but give the highest reputation guy to group
So this strategy should works fine
And routine this process until the group is filled or all people have had a group.
